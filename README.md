UnityPlanets is a lightweight and approachable Marching Cubes implementation designed to make procedural, fully editable terrain easy to understand and extend. Modern, beginner-friendly examples of Marching Cubes can be complex to come by. 
This project aims to fill that gap by providing a clean and modular starting point for learning, experimenting, and building custom voxel terrain systems in Unity.

Using Perlin noise for basic terrain shaping, UnityPlanets supports multiple types of terrain generation, including spherical planets, endless flat landscapes, and cave systems. The system is built with an endless chunk architecture in mind, providing clean examples for managing active chunks, applying detail levels, and customizing terrain on the fly.

- Apply different sets of layered noise for terrain variety.
- Add procedural foliage through a FoliageGenerator system.
- Implement custom brushes (round, square, triangle) for terrain editing.
- Extend terrain features like vertex coloring, mesh rebuilding, and real-time modification.


This project uses a few Unity Asset Store packages to enhance the visual quality of demo scenes shown in screenshots. While you might come across occasional 
references or comments about these assets, they are not required to run or use the project. Everything included works independently of the third-party packages I have installed but I do highly recommend them.

Using FoliageGenerator simple terrain is supported.
